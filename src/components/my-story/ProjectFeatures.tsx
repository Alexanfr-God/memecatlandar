        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">It's not just a platform—it's a launchpad for creativity, a calendar for stories waiting to be told, and a community that champions new ideas. Whether you're here to explore, support, or create, you're part of something bigger.</p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">When I first dreamed of this project, I envisioned a space that was simple yet powerful, structured yet open. Now that dream has come to life, and it's all for you. I'm truly grateful for each and every person who joins this journey. Together, we can make memes more than fleeting jokes; we can turn them into stories, trends, and cultural milestones.</p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg font-bold">Thank you for being here. Let's create, connect, and make meme history—one card at a time.</p>
