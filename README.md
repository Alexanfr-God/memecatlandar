## Ads Frame Integration

MemeCatLandar includes a special **Ads Frame** feature that displays user-submitted memes from **MEMECAWHEEL**â€”our dedicated fundraising project. This feature is designed to increase engagement while contributing to the liquidity pool for our **MemeCatLandar (MEMECA)** token.

By promoting memes through Ads Frame, users help support the growth of the platform and the token ecosystem, creating a mutually beneficial system for both meme creators and token holders.
